## Known issues
### Unstable USB (data-) connectivity
The Nano 33 IoT's AREF-pin is connected to the VUSB-pin (5V). This seems to interfere with the microcontroller's capability to maintain a stable (uninterrupted) USB data-connectivity.

As a workaround temporarily remove the connection of AREF to VUSB. (Note: While that connection is removed, some of the LCD Keypad Shield's button will stop working.)
